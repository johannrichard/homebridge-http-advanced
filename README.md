# homebridge-mystrom

**Update**: This plugin has been replaced by the new [homebridge-dingz-da](https://github.com/johannrichard/homebridge-dingz-da) plugin which not only adds support for the [DingZ](https://dingz.ch) devices but also adds auto-discovery for MyStrom WiFi Switches (CH V2 & EU): Just add the `homebridge-dingz-da` platform to your `homebridge` config and see your WiFi Switches appear magically in Home.
